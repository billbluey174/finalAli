**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 2)_
### Idea 1

I love cooking, but I am also a time-limited broke college student. Therefore, with my limited ingredients, I struggle to find more variety than just fried rice every night. My idea is for an application on the phone which you can give it a list of ingredients you have and it suggest recipes. When you cook a dish, you mark if you used up any ingredients. When you shop, you mark that you bought more.
 
Main parts of the project:
- Creating an accessible database of recipes

To create this feature, we might need to create a web-scraper to go through and find potential recipes. There also might be an existing database of recipes that we can use.

- Sorting through said database based on a combination of available ingredients and time

This will require having a database of the user’s food. I don’t think this feature will be that hard.

- User experience must be prioritized

TA review: Approved pending change - this idea needs to be more algorithmically complex (specify how).

### Idea 2

Check-in social media app. My idea for an app revolves around a “check-in” feature that users use to check into locations around their community (kind of like a more in-depth SnapMaps). I think this would make for a great college app, and envision it being sort of like a social media network. For example, at Brown, users can check into set locations like the sci-li, their dorm, the Ratty, classrooms, the Blue Room, etc. so that their friends can see what they’re up to. Upon checking in, they can have the option of creating an event (think anything from pregames to club meetings) that they can broadcast/advertise to their network, and also attach a short picture and description to their location as a status. This app would require a lot of privacy control/thought to protect each user’s privacy and data, and I expect it will be quite challenging to think of complete privacy protection.

TA review: Rejected - this is essentially Foursquare, and also there is no significant algorithmic component to the project.

### Idea 3

There are two problems that I would like to solve when it comes to playing music. The first issue is having the perfect playlist that whole group loves and has input on. Whether you’re just chilling out with friends or at a party trying to request that song you just really need to hear right now, there’s no way to ensure that the song you really want to hear gets played. The second issue is just being able to sync your music and play from your phones at the same time. You’re skiing down a mountain with friends and you all want to listen to the same track, maybe you forgot the speaker and you just want to listen to some music. There’s no solid platform to be able to accomplish these tasks. My idea is a piece of software that 1) Allows users to share and manipulate a running queue of songs and 2) Allows said music to be streamed simultaneously across devices. 

The challenging parts of this project would be:

-	Incorporating audio
-	Interfacing with streaming like Spotify and apple music
-	Managing who gets to control music and who doesn’t
-	Ensuring that music is synced across devices.

TA review: Approved - note this is a common idea across groups. 

**Note:** You do not have to resubmit ideas.
